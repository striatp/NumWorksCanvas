### 2. `README.md` for `Circle`

```markdown
# Circle

The `Circle` class allows you to create and manipulate circles on the canvas. You can draw circles at specified coordinates with a defined radius and color.

## Installation

Ensure you have the `kandinsky` module available in your NumWorks calculator.

## Usage Example

```python
from canvas import Circle

# Create a circle at (100, 100) with a radius of 50 and red color
circle = Circle(100, 100, 50, "red")

# Draw the circle on the canvas
circle.draw()

# Remove the circle from the canvas
circle.destroy()
```
